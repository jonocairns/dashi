# FAQ
Q: *I'm having problems with something on the server. What should I do?*

A: Click the 'discord' link from the [dashboard](https://cairns.co.nz). You will need to sign up for an account and post a message in the #help or #general channel.

Q: *I want to request something... Where / who can I contact?*

A: I've automated most of this work. You can access [request via the dashboard](https://cairns.co.nz/ombi). Use the same login you use for plex. Then go to movies/tv and search for the item you want, then hit request. This will automatically try and find the item and download it.

Q: *What are other people watching?*

A: you can access anonymized watch statistics [here](https://cairns.co.nz/stats). Use the same login for plex (assuming you have been granted access).

Q: *I can't access the server! WTF?*

A: Check [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/oZkN8t4lA) for the current status of the server. If you cannot access this page there is something wrong on your end. If the current status is down then it's something on my end. Post/check discord to see if there are changes or maintance currently underway.
